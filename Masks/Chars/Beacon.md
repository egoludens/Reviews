Ходы:
**No powers and not nearly enough training:**
You’re always picking up new gear to keep
yourself in the game. Whenever you pick up a
new piece of gear, you can write it in as a new
ability if this line is empty.
_______________________________
The first time you use each piece of gear to
directly engage a threat, unleash your powers, or
defend someone, you can roll + Mundane instead
of the normal Label.

**Suck it, Domitian:** When you stand strong while
dramatically under fire, roll + Savior instead of
+ Danger to directly engage a threat.
